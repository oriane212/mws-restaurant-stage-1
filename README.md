Restaurant Reviews
========================================
This project began as a static website (provided by Udacity) and has been converted into a responsive, accessible, offline-ready web application for browsing restaurant reviews by location and/or cuisine.

## Dependencies
- No `npm` dependencies, just clone all files included in the repo.
- `sw.js` is the service worker file necessary for enabling offline use.

## How to run the app
1. Clone this repo.
2. Launch the app with a simple HTTP server, such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` for Python 2.x or `python3 -m http.server 8000` for Python 3.x.
3. With the server running, go to `http://localhost:8000` in the browser.
